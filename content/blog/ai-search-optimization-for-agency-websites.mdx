## GEO starts with structure, not hacks

AI-assisted search systems rely heavily on well-structured, semantically clear content. If your website has shallow service pages, weak internal linking, and missing schema, it becomes harder for these systems to extract reliable answers.

## Build pages around retrievable entities

For agencies, entity clarity means:

- Define your organization clearly
- Describe each service with unambiguous outcomes
- Connect case studies to service pages
- Attach author profiles and update timestamps to content

This helps both users and retrieval systems trust the context.

## Content depth still matters

AI systems can summarize quickly, but they still need rich source material. Service pages with 800+ words, process transparency, FAQs, and proof sections often perform better for discoverability than thin promotional copy.

## Internal linking is your retrieval graph

Treat internal links as a semantic graph:

- Blog posts should point to service pages
- Service pages should link to case studies
- Tools and guides should reference relevant service execution pages

This graph signals topical authority and improves user journey clarity.

## Schema implementation priorities

Start with:

1. Organization schema in the global layout
2. Service schema on service detail pages
3. Article schema on blog posts
4. FAQPage schema where FAQs are present
5. BreadcrumbList schema on deep routes

Do not add irrelevant schema types. Specificity matters more than volume.

## E-E-A-T signals for agency credibility

Strengthen trust signals:

- Publish real case studies with measurable outcomes
- Show author and team expertise
- Add legal pages and accessibility statement
- Maintain fresh last-updated dates on key content

These signals reduce ambiguity for both users and machines.

## Practical GEO checklist

- One clear H1 per page
- Explicit section headings for scannability
- Concise definitions for each service
- FAQ blocks answering real objections
- Strong canonical and metadata hygiene
