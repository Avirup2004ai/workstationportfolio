## Overview

This draft outlines a practical creative testing system for teams running Meta and Google campaigns.

## Testing structure

- Define one goal per cycle (CTR, CPL, CVR)
- Test one primary variable at a time
- Keep landing page and audience stable while testing creative

## Suggested weekly cadence

- Monday: launch variants
- Wednesday: early signal review
- Friday: winner retention + next cycle planning

## Common mistakes

- Changing audience, creative, and landing page simultaneously
- Ending tests too early based on small sample size
- Ignoring creative fatigue signals
