## Overview

Budget planning should match funnel maturity, not trends.

## Suggested split

- 50-60% prospecting
- 20-30% mid-funnel engagement
- 15-25% remarketing

## Guardrails

- Define stop-loss rules for weak ad sets
- Reallocate weekly based on lead quality and CPL
- Keep creative refresh cadence predictable
