faqs:
  - question: "How many service pages should an SME website have?"
    answer: "Start with one page per core service and expand only when each page can be uniquely valuable and conversion-focused."
  - question: "Is one long homepage enough for SEO?"
    answer: "No. A single page cannot cover multiple high-intent topics deeply enough for sustained search performance."
  - question: "Should I prioritize blogs or service pages first?"
    answer: "Prioritize service pages first, then publish blogs that support the service intent clusters."

## Why architecture decides your SEO ceiling

Many SME websites in India struggle with SEO because they treat architecture as an afterthought. Pages are created reactively when a campaign needs a destination, not as part of a coherent discovery system. The result is weak internal linking, overlapping topics, and shallow pages that cannot rank competitively for intent-heavy keywords.

An SEO-first architecture solves this by defining a clear page hierarchy before content production starts. It maps user intent to page types and helps both search engines and users understand where to find relevant information.

## Step 1: Map intent clusters before building pages

Start with user intent, not keyword volume alone. For most service businesses, you need at least four intent buckets:

1. Commercial service intent
2. Comparison or evaluation intent
3. Educational intent
4. Trust validation intent

Your `/services/*` pages should satisfy commercial intent and include clear outcomes, process, FAQs, and proof. Evaluation intent is often served by `/work/*` case studies and `/pricing` pages. Educational intent belongs in `/resources/blog` and `/resources/guides`.

## Step 2: Define page roles and avoid overlap

Each page should have one primary job:

- Homepage: summarize value and route users to deeper pages.
- Service pages: convert high-intent users.
- Case studies: provide proof and de-risk decisions.
- Blog posts: capture informational demand and pass relevance to services.

When page roles are unclear, content overlaps and keyword cannibalization appears. Keep a simple sheet that lists primary keyword theme, secondary support themes, and conversion goal for every important page.

## Step 3: Design internal linking as a growth loop

Internal links should not be random. They should move users through a logical journey:

- Blog post → relevant service page
- Service page → related case study
- Case study → proposal CTA

This loop improves discoverability and conversion quality together. It also helps AI-search systems infer topical authority when your site shows consistent semantic relationships.

If you want templates for these relationships, use the [Website Audit Checklist Generator](/resources/tools) to identify missing links quickly.

## Step 4: Build semantic depth with structured sections

Service pages that rank and convert usually include:

- Who this service is for
- Deliverables and process
- Timelines
- Regional market considerations
- FAQs that address real objections

This structure improves relevance signals and keeps content readable. It also makes schema implementation cleaner because FAQs and service entities are explicit.

## Step 5: Add governance so architecture scales

Architecture breaks when teams publish without rules. Introduce simple governance:

- Content brief template with intent and linking requirements
- Naming conventions for URL slugs
- Review checklist for metadata and schema
- Update cadence for stale content

If your team already has a site but weak structure, start with high-value pages and refactor in phases. You do not need to rebuild everything at once.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Using generic `/services` content without dedicated service pages
- Publishing blogs with no links to money pages
- Ignoring mobile page experience on key commercial pages
- Updating designs without content architecture updates

## Recommended implementation sequence

1. Define service page map
2. Launch or improve key service pages
3. Add 2-3 case studies
4. Publish support articles linked to services
5. Review internal links monthly

## FAQ

### Can I keep old URLs while redesigning architecture?

Yes, but set redirect rules carefully and maintain topic continuity on destination pages.

### How often should we update service pages?

Review quarterly, especially when offers, pricing bands, or positioning change.
