## Challenge

The client had strong product capability but low online discoverability. Their old site contained thin category pages, duplicate metadata, and weak internal linking. Technical SEO issues limited crawling efficiency, and users had little contextual guidance after landing on key pages.

Most incoming business still depended on distributor referrals, which created growth constraints.

## Strategy

We designed a phased SEO and website modernization plan:

1. Technical cleanup to improve crawlability and indexing quality.
2. Deep service and category content tied to buyer intent clusters.
3. Conversion-path improvements with proof content and clearer B2B inquiry flows.

We also mapped a resource strategy to support semantic coverage and authority signals.

## Execution

### Technical SEO foundation

Canonical logic, sitemap structure, and robots rules were corrected. Page hierarchy was simplified to reduce crawl waste. Structured data was added for services, FAQs, and organization context.

### Content depth and architecture

High-intent category pages were expanded with use-case narratives, specification guidance, and FAQ clusters. Internal links were rebuilt to connect informational content with commercial pages.

### Conversion improvements

Contact touchpoints were redesigned with lower friction and clearer segmentation for bulk and recurring orders. Trust blocks included operational capacity indicators and client proof snippets.

## Results

Across seven months:

- Organic inbound inquiries increased by 211%.
- Number of indexed high-intent pages rose by 67%.
- Average time on key service pages improved by 58%.
- Bounce rate reduced by 22%.

The business started receiving consistent inbound wholesale conversations without proportionally increasing paid spend.

## Timeline

- Month 1-2: Technical audit, fixes, and architecture planning.
- Month 3-4: Content expansion and internal linking program.
- Month 5-7: Conversion optimization and authority-building content support.

## Strategic Impact

The client reduced dependence on low-visibility referral cycles and gained a scalable inbound channel with stronger margin control.
