## Challenge

The travel agency relied on seasonal spikes and referral-heavy acquisition. Digital campaigns existed, but messaging was inconsistent and ad budgets were spread thin across too many campaign types. The team struggled to maintain content cadence, and organic and paid channels operated separately.

Lead quality was another issue. Many inquiries lacked booking intent, which increased sales workload and reduced team confidence in digital channels.

## Strategy

We aligned the account around a simple demand model:

1. Organic social builds trust with destination insights, itinerary education, and social proof.
2. Paid campaigns amplify top-performing content themes.
3. Landing experiences pre-qualify inquiries with clear package and budget framing.

We introduced a monthly content system, creative production checklist, and weekly media review routine.

## Execution

### Content and community layer

A channel strategy was created for Instagram and Facebook with distinct pillar formats:

- Planning support content for early-stage consideration.
- Traveler testimonials for trust reinforcement.
- Offer-led content for conversion windows.

Community response templates improved response consistency and reduced missed follow-ups.

### Paid campaign structure

Campaigns were reorganized by audience stage, and budget allocation shifted toward high-intent segments. Underperforming creatives were replaced using structured tests around offer framing and destination specificity.

### Conversion flow

Inquiry forms were simplified and mapped to travel package tiers. This improved intent clarity and reduced noise in lead routing.

## Results

In five months:

- Monthly qualified inquiries increased by 139%.
- Cost per booking inquiry dropped by 27%.
- Social engagement rate stabilized near 3.9%.
- Campaign ROAS improved to 4.2x.

The client also reported better alignment between marketing and sales conversations due to clearer lead context.

## Timeline

- Month 1: Audit and plan reset.
- Month 2: Content system launch + campaign structure cleanup.
- Month 3-4: Creative testing and conversion form optimization.
- Month 5: Scale phase and reporting cadence maturity.

## Tools Used
